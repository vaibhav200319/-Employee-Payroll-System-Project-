The Employee Management System is a console-based Core Java application designed to manage employee details and payroll operations efficiently.
This project demonstrates strong understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation.

The system supports both Full-Time and Part-Time employees and calculates their salaries based on different salary structures.
